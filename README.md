# google_mini_misactivations
research study on the misactivations of a google home mini 

This project was done by tracking google mini queries on Google's Devices UI and seeing how the queries Google considered legitimate corresponded with network activity produced by the Mini when the queries were made. Voice recording samples, 30+ hours of usable data, was collected and tested against the mini to see if there were any predictable misfires indicated by increased network activity at the time of the false wake word. Wireshark was used extensively for this project, and the Mini was isolated from all other network activity and noise during the duration of the tests. 

Included in this repository are the network traces from preliminary and final tests, as well as the final summary of work. Voice recordings are not included for privacy reasons.
